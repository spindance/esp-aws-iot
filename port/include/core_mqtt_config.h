/**
 * @brief Determines the maximum number of MQTT PUBLISH messages, pending

 *
 * QoS 1 and 2 MQTT PUBLISHes require acknowledgement from the server before
 * they can be completed. While they are awaiting the acknowledgement, the
 * client must maintain information about their state. The value of this
 * macro sets the limit on how many simultaneous PUBLISH states an MQTT
 * context maintains, separately, for both incoming and outgoing direction of
 * PUBLISHes.
 *
 * @note The MQTT context maintains separate state records for outgoing
 * and incoming PUBLISHes, and thus, 2 * MQTT_STATE_ARRAY_MAX_COUNT amount
 * of memory is statically allocated for the state records.
